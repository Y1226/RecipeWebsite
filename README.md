## Recipe Sharing Website

This is a basic website where users can view recipes shared by others. Users have the option to create an account or log in to an existing account. Once logged in, users can add, edit, or delete their own recipes.

### Features:

- View recipes shared by other users.
- Create an account or log in to an existing account.
- If signed in, users can:
  - Add a new recipe.
  - Edit recipes associated with their username.
  - Delete recipes associated with their username.

### Project Background:

I developed this website as a school assignment to demonstrate my ability to build a full-stack application using SQL Server, Node.js, and Angular. The project requirements were to create a recipe-sharing platform with the following functionality:

- Allow users to view recipes.
- Provide the option to create an account or log in.
- Enable signed-in users to add, edit, or delete recipes associated with their account.

### Additional Requirements:

In addition to meeting the core project requirements, I was also tasked with including the following:

- Implementing a Directive
- Utilizing a Pipe
- Designing the user interface using Bootstrap

My project successfully fulfills all specified requirements, and I received a high grade for its completion.
